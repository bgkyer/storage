In order to represent the diverse characteristics of real physical storage facilities there are many different ways of creating CmdtyStorage instances. This workbook gives an overview of the different options available."

The code below gives an example of how this can be used to provide piecewise flat values which vary by year of a three year storage facility. This is relevant where storage is leased and as such a different nominal amount of storage facility is accessible per time period. Although not shown below min_inventory, max_injection_rate and max_withdrawal_rate can also be time-varying."
